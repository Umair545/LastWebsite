            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Literacy is popularly understood as an ability to read and write in at
                least one method of writing, an understanding reflected by mainstream dictionaries.[1][2][3] In this
                view, illiteracy would be considered to be the inability to read and write.[4][5][6]

                Some researchers suggest that the history of interest in the concept of “literacy” can be divided into
                two periods. Firstly is the period before 1950, when literacy was understood solely as alphabetical
                literacy (word and letter recognition). Secondly is the period after 1950, when literacy slowly began to
                be considered as a wider concept and process, including the social and cultural aspects of reading and
                writing,[7] and functional literacy (Dijanošić, 2009).The diversity among the definitions of literacy
                used by NGOs, think tanks, and advocacy groups since the 1990s suggests that this shift in understanding
                from "discrete skill" to "social practice" is both ongoing and uneven. Some of the definitions below
                remain fairly closely aligned with the traditional "ability to read and write" connotation, whereas
                others take a broader view.The widening of the traditional concept of literacy took place as consensus
                emerged among researchers in composition studies, education research, and anthropological linguistics
                that it makes little sense to speak of reading or writing outside of some specific context—a position
                James Paul Gee describes as "simply incoherent."[42] For example, even extremely early stages of
                acquiring mastery over symbol-shapes take place in particular social contexts (even if that context is
                simply "school"), and after print acquisition, any instance of reading and writing will always be
                enacted for a particular purpose and occasion and with particular readers and writers in mind. Reading
                and writing, therefore, are never separable from social and cultural elements.[43][44][45][46] A
                corollary point, made by David Barton and Rosalind (Roz) Ivanic, among others, is that the effects of
                literacy acquisition on cognition and social relations are not easily predictable, since, as Brian
                Street has argued, "the ways in which people address reading and writing are themselves rooted in
                conceptions of knowledge, identity, [and] being

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods
                include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes
                place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take
                place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one
                thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most regions, education is
                compulsory up to a certain age.

                There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
                towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large,
                or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some
                governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development
                Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">According to social anthropologist Jack Goody, there are two
                interpretations that regard the origin of the alphabet. Many classical scholars, such as historian
                Ignace Gelb, credit the Ancient Greeks for creating the first alphabetic system (c. 750 BCE) that used
                distinctive signs for consonants and vowels. But Goody contests, "The importance of Greek culture of the
                subsequent history of Western Europe has led to an over-emphasis, by classicists and others, on the
                addition of specific vowel signs to the set of consonantal ones that had been developed earlier in
                Western Asia".[61]

                Thus, many scholars argue that the ancient Semitic-speaking peoples of northern Canaan (modern-day
                Syria) invented the consonantal alphabet as early as 1500 BCE. Much of this theory's development is
                credited to English archeologist Flinders Petrie, who, in 1905, came across a series of Canaanite
                inscriptions located in the turquoise mines of Serabit el-Khadem. Ten years later, English Egyptologist
                Alan Gardiner reasoned that these letters contain an alphabet, as well as references to the Canaanite
                goddess Asherah. In 1948, William F. Albright deciphered the text using additional evidence that had
                been discovered subsequent to Goody's findings. This included a series of inscriptions from Ugarit,
                discovered in 1929 by French archaeologist Claude F. A. Schaeffer. Some of these inscriptions were
                mythological texts (written in an early Canaanite dialect) that consisted of a 32-letter cuneiform
                consonantal alphabet.

                Another significant discovery was made in 1953 when three arrowheads were uncovered, each containing
                identical Canaanite inscriptions from twelfth century BCE. According to Frank Moore Cross, these
                inscriptions consisted of alphabetic signs that originated during the transitional development from
                pictographic script to a linear alphabet. Moreover, he asserts, "These inscriptions also provided clues
                to extend the decipherment of earlier and later alphabetic texts
